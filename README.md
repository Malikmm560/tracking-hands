✋ Hand Tracking with Python, OpenCV & Mediapipe
So this project is a basic hand-tracking setup built with Python, OpenCV, and Mediapipe. It’s simple right now, but there’s a lot you can customize here if you’re looking to build more advanced stuff! Perfect if you’re starting with hand tracking or just want to play around with real-time hand detection. Here’s a breakdown:

⚙️ What It Does
Tracks your hand in real-time through the webcam
Uses Mediapipe for hand landmarks (finger joints, wrist, etc.)
Built with OpenCV for video processing and display
Super simple code that you can build off or just use as-is
🛠 How to Get Started
Clone this repository:
bash
Copy code
git clone <your-repo-url>
Install OpenCV and Mediapipe (super quick):
bash
Copy code
pip install opencv-python mediapipe
Run the script:
bash
Copy code
python hand_tracking.py
🔧 Customizations & Ideas
Gesture Recognition: Customize the script to detect specific hand signs or gestures, like a thumbs-up 👍 or a peace sign ✌️.
VR/AR Projects: Use this as a base for a VR or AR setup with hand-tracking interactions 🕶️.
Sign Language Recognition: Could expand this to recognize parts of sign language movements 👋.
🚀 What You Can Add
This is just the starting point! You could add:

Multiple hand tracking 🤲
Controls based on gestures (maybe control music with hand signs? 🎶)
Interaction with virtual objects (perfect for creative projects) 💡
